### About
A very simple and barebones platformer. Acts more as a learning experience for myself. Consider this more as a reference for other projects rather than an actual game.

You play as a round cat jumping through a dangerous land full of enemies and spikes

### Demo
You can get playable builds [here](https://github.com/EliasVincent/simple-godot-platformer/releases/)
